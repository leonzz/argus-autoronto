## System Diagram

Note: we've abandoned a Unity based approach in favor of the following new approach:

## Components:

- [`rosbridge-xviz-connector`](rosbridge-xviz-connector): A data proxy server that read from rosbridge-server and serves data in [XVIZ](https://github.com/uber/xviz) format, which is a opensource protocol from Uber to stream/visualize autonomy data.

- [GUI](gui): A web UI based on Uber's [streetscape.gl](https://github.com/uber/streetscape.gl) which is specialized to visualize data in XVIZ format. Right now we are using the demo example from [streetscape.gl](https://github.com/uber/streetscape.gl/tree/master/examples/get-started) with some minor changes.

- Map Tile Server: A map tile server that reads local OpenStreemMap data files and serve map images to the GUI.

## Build and Run

Note: If running from a VM, make sure to enable 3D acceleration for it's graphics setting.

1. Follow the steps (1, 2, and 4) in [rosbridge-xviz-connector](rosbridge-xviz-connector) to start the neccessary services.

2. Start the GUI

    For best performance, use `cd gui && yarn build` to build the webpage into `gui/dist/` folder and then open `gui/dist/index.html` with a browser.

    Or optionally, use the following step to run a dev server for easier debugging:

    ```
    cd gui
    # please run yarn install before the next command to download dependencies
    export MapboxAccessToken=<your mapbox token>

    # to run the dev server with debugging capability:
    yarn start
    ```

    A browser window will automatically open and connect to the server from step 1.


3. In developement/simulation mode, play the rosbag to start piping in data, e.g.

    ```
    rosbag play /mnt/hgfs/argus-autoronto/project-data/_2019-01-18-15-19-31_public_roads.bag
    ```

4. After starting the rosbag, if the UI is not updated, refresh the browser window. Since some rosbag recordings are very short, be sensitive to the timing of refresh and play.
